I remember when Xanga and LiveJournal were the hottest trends in blogging. Maybe reliving the experience of the countless hours I spent dumping content into those sites (before we ever called it "content") has got me excited. So I've created http://blog.tonelope.com and here's an unexciting `"Hello World"` first post.

I've wanted to create a blog for as long as I can remember. I've tried several times before and just never seemed to keep consistent enough to log content. I find myself doing a similar thing when trying to keep a journal up-to-date. It isn't uncommon that I'd see a journal post for maybe three consecutive days and then completely fall off the wagon and see the next journal entry three months later. With this entry, I'm hoping to turn a new leaf on blogging or journaling... whatever this turns into being. I just want a place to be able to write down whatever I'm thinking about, working on, or experiences coupled with the ability to control the look and feel of my blog using whatever latest programming languages, tools, or platforms I feel like hacking away on.

As of writing this post, this platform is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a nifty little `Go` library that allows for posts in a number of different formats (Text, Markdown, AsciiDoc) and customized theming through basic `HTML/JS`. I'll likely start playing around with the themes to create my own look and feel and tie it back to the overall theme that I have on http://tonelope.com.
